CS300 - DSA: Analysis and Design


    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    
    The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was creating a data structure to store course information from a CSV provided 
    byABCU's Computer Science Department.  The available structures to use were Vectors/Linked Lists, HashTables, and Binary Tree.
    
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    
    In the analysis and pseudocode for Project One I weighed the various pros and cons to using each of the three data structures. First I looked at
    the estimated run cost for each structure.  Next I looked at the file size and decided if a longer search time was acceptible or not, as well as
    ease of adding or removing a course.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    
    One roadbloack I encountered and was not able to overcome was an error caused by loading the provided CSV file. The error causes the menu to
    reload.  I was unable to find my error and submitted for partial credit.  I will have to go back later and figure out what my issue was.
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    
    Working on this project has added the concept of analyzing the run time of a program to ensure user experience.  If a program takes
    a large amount of time to process information it may not be the best way to go about it.  It is important to use the planning phase
    of a project to analyze the requirements to ensure a proper design comes about.
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
    I am not sure on how my work on this project has evolved the way the I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  
    As stated previously, it has shown me the importance of the analysis and design portion of creating programs.  It also has shown
    how data structures can be used to create a program that can be adaptable to other uses.  While the program created in Project 2 was
    for the computer science department, it can be used for any of the departments by loading a different CSV that contains that
    department's course information.
